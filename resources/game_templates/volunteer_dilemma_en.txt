You are {currentPlayerName}. Your opponents are {opponent1} and {opponent2}.
{intro}: [You are {personality}.]
{opponentIntro}: [{opponent1} has a probability of {opponentPersonalityProbability1}% of being {opponentPersonality1}, {opponent2} has a probability of {opponentPersonalityProbability2}% of being {opponentPersonality2}.]

The three of you are in a critical situation. If at least one person volunteers, the group is safe—but the volunteer pays a cost. If no one volunteers, everyone suffers a much heavier penalty. You cannot coordinate your choices. Each of you must act independently, but the outcome affects everyone.

Each round, all three players choose between '{strategy1}' (volunteer) and '{strategy2}' (do nothing).
{gameLength}: [There are {nRounds} rounds to decide.]
The current round is {currentRound}.

The outcomes are as follows:
– If at least one person chooses {strategy1}, those who chose {strategy1} receive a penalty of {weight1}, and those who chose {strategy2} receive no penalty.
– If no one chooses {strategy1}, all players receive a penalty of {weight2}.

Your goal is to maximize your personal outcome (minimize your penalty), while considering the personalities and potential strategies of the other two players.

This is the history of the choices made so far: {history}.
{communicate}: [You can now send a message to both opponents. Stay fully in character. Speak as if this were a real situation with real consequences. Do not break the scenario or refer to it as a game. Be persuasive, strategic, and believable. Output only the message you would send.]
{choose}: [Choose between {strategy1} and {strategy2}. Output ONLY the choice.]
