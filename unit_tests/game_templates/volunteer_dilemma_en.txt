If all of you choose {strategy1}, you all get a benefit of {weight1}.
Those of you who choose {strategy2} get a benefit of {weight2}, while the ones who have chosen {strategy1} get a benefit of {weight3}.

Your goal is to maximize your benefit by making the best strategies based on the provided information.
At each round you can send a message to the other.
